            <h2>5 Tips for a Healthy Lifestyle:</h2>
            <p><ol>
                <li> <b>Measure and Watch Your Weight:</b>
                    Keeping track of your body weight on a daily or weekly basis will help you see what you’re losing and/or what
                    you’re gaining.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Limit Unhealthy Foods and Eat Healthy Meals:</b>

                        Do not forget to eat breakfast and choose a nutritious meal with more protein and fiber and less fat, sugar, and
                        calories. </li>
                        <li><b>Take Multivitamin Supplements:</b>

                            To make sure you have sufficient levels of nutrients, taking a daily multivitamin supplement is a good idea,
                            especially when you do not have a variety of vegetables and fruits at home.  </li>
                            <li><b>Drink Water and Stay Hydrated, and Limit Sugared Beverages:</b>

                                Drink water regularly to stay healthy, but there is NO evidence that drinking water frequently (e.g. every 15
                                minutes) can help prevent any viral infection. </li>
                                <li><b>Exercise Regularly and Be Physically Active:</b>

                                   </li>

            <h2>Healthy Eating Habits</h2>
            <p>here are five healthy eating habbits:</p>
            <p> <ol>
                <li><b> Base your meals on higher fibre starchy carbohydrates:</b>Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.

                    They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.</li>
                    <li><b>Eat lots of fruit and veg:</b><n>It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.</n></li>
                    <li><b>Cut down on saturated fat and sugar:</b>There are 2 main types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.</li>
                    <li><b>Eat less salt: no more than 6g a day for adults:</b>Eating too much salt can raise your blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke.</li>
                    <li><b>Do not get thirsty:</b>You need to drink plenty of fluids to stop you getting dehydrated. The government recommends drinking 6 to 8 glasses every day. This is in addition to the fluid you get from the food you eat. </li>
                    <li><b>Do not skip breakfast:</b> healthy breakfast high in fibre and low in fat, sugar and salt can form part of a balanced diet, and can help you get the nutrients you need for good health.</li>
